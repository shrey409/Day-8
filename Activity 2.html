    <h1>Inspirational talk</h1>

  <p>When I think of superheroes I think of super humans.
    I think of Superman, Wolverine and Wonder Woman.
    Usually they have a cape, or a mask to hide their face just in case.
    They have X-ray vision and super-human strength.
    Some can even breathe in outer space.
    They fly around a while, but always come back to keep our cities safe.
    They’re here to save humanity from itself.
    It’s a metaphor for how we look outside ourselves for help, and while the fantasies are fun, I choose to look for me and you.

    We don’t need superheroes, we have super powers, too.
    It starts with being open to this moment.
    If you do then you can own it.
    Besides, it will be gone before you know it, so don’t blow it.
    You owe it to this second of eternity to show up, embrace the possibilities, and slow up, take a breath, and look around, see the sites, and hear the sounds, feel the ground, notice how the gravity holds you down.

    You could be anywhere in the world, and, yet, you’re here.
    When you accept that choice as your own, you can begin to overcome your fear.
    And real courage is looking in the mirror, it’s deciding what you want to do, then making that appear.
    It’s innovating out of thin air, we must be doing something right if we get scared.
    Otherwise, we wouldn’t care.
    It’s a process to get here to there, here to there.
    There is no here or there.
    There’s only here.

    We’re on the journey and we’re learning, but building muscle means you’re going to feel the burning, so don’t deny it, simplify it, try it.
    See if it can work for you, change perspective to get a different view, and don’t forget you got to laugh at the truth, because, sometimes, your sense of humor will be the only thing that can pull you through.
    It’s medicine when you can let it in.
    An attitude of gratitude will bring a positive spin, so even when the storm clouds block the blue from your sky, you’ll remember that the sun is waiting for you on the other side.

    And having fun is something we must decide, from the lows to the highs.
    It’s all a part of the ride.
    I can throw my hands up.
    Or I can hold on for dear life, hold on for dear life, but I’d rather live once than have to go to hell twice.
    <br>

    Compassion is my passion.
    Empathy is my gift, but my growth is incremental as my consciousness shifts, so I create from an abyss, turning pain into gold.
    I’m an alchemist, an optimist, and an authentic soul.
    I believe that life is good, even when it hurts to see.
    I believe in superpowers, and I believe in you and me.
    I believe in superheroes but I don’t look for them above because they exist inside us all and we save the day with love.</p>
